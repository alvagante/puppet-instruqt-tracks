description: |-
  In this lab, you'll learn an easy and straightforward process for installing Puppet Enterprise enabling you to start automating your infrastructure on day one.

  Your lab environment consists of:
   - A target server for the primary server installation.
   - A number of other servers (a mix of Windows & Linux nodes) that you will manage agents on.


  Your objective is to enable continuous audit and compliance over all systems in your environment:
   - Ensure visibility of all currently installed packages and versions.
   - Identify each server's role in your environment.

  assignment: |-
    1. On the **Puppet Server** tab, download the tarball:
    ```
    curl -JLO 'https://pm.puppet.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi?dist=el&rel=7&arch=x86_64&ver=2019.8.6'
    ```

    2. Unpack the installation tarball:
    ```
    tar -xf puppet-enterprise-2019.8.6-el-7-x86_64.tar.gz
    ```
    3. Run the Puppet Enterprise installer. When prompted, enter Y to proceed:
    ```
    ./puppet-enterprise-2019.8.6-el-7-x86_64/puppet-enterprise-installer
    ```
    4. Set the password for the console to **puppetlabs** (you will use this password to log into PE once it is installed):
    ```
    puppet infrastructure console_password --password=puppetlabs
    ```
    5. Run the following command <b>twice</b> to complete the Puppet Server installation [enter information to explain what running the command twice does/why its necessary]:
    ```
    puppet agent -t
    ```
    6. Check the status of Puppet services from the command line:
    ```
    puppet infrastructure status
    ```

    7. Switch to the **Console** tab.

    8. Log in with `admin` and password `puppetlabs` (the password you set in Step 4).

    9. On the **Status** page, click "Puppet Services status" (shown at the top right of the page). In the drop-down menu, you should see something similar to the following:

    10. Review the list to ensure all services are running.

    Congratulations! You installed and configured the PE Server.
