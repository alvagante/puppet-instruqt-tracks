    # Lab 1.0: Install PE server

    ## Objective recap

    Your objective is to enable continuous audit and compliance over all systems in your environment:
    Ensure visibility of all currently installed packages and versions.
    Identify each server's role in your environment.

    In this lab you will learn how to install and configure the PE server.

    1. In the Puppet Server tab, download the tarball:
    ```
    curl -JLO 'https://pm.puppet.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi?dist=el&rel=7&arch=x86_64&ver=latest'
    ```

    2. Unpack the installation tarball:
    ```
    tar -xf puppet-enterprise-2021.1.0-el-7-x86_64.tar.gz
    ```
    3. From the installer directory, run the installer..
    ```
    ./puppet-enterprise-2021.1.0-el-7-x86_64/puppet-enterprise-installer
    ```
    4. Set the password for the console:
    ```
    puppet infrastructure console_password --password=puppetlabs
    ```
    5. Run the following command twice to complete the puppet server installation:
    ```
    puppet agent -t
    ```
    6. Check the status of the puppet services from the command line:
    ```puppet infrastructure status```

    ## The PE Console

    7. In the Instruq browser window, switch to the tab named Console.

    8. Log in with `admin` and password `puppetlabs` (the password you set in Step 4).

    9. On the Status page, click "Puppet Services status." You should see something similar to the following:
