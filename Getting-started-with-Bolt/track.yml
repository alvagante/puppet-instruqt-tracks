    is an open source orchestration tool that automates the manual work it takes to
    maintain your infrastructure. You can use Bolt to automate tasks that you perform
    on an as-needed basis or as part of a greater orchestration workflow.\n\nBolt
    can be installed on your local workstation and connects directly to remote targets
    with SSH or WinRM, so you are not required to install any agent software.\nUse
    Bolt to:\n- Patch and update systems\n- Troubleshoot servers\n- Deploy applications\n-
    Stop and restart services\n\n# Install Bolt\nThe best way to learn how Bolt works
    is try it out for yourself.\n\n**Step 1**\nBegin by installing Bolt. In order
    to do this, you must configure the Bolt yum repository. (This is required because
    standard Linux installations are not configured with the Bolt repository.)\n\nTo
    configure the repository, run the following command: \n```\nrpm -Uvh https://yum.puppet.com/puppet-tools-release-el-7.noarch.rpm\n```\n\n**Step
    2**\nNow install Bolt by running this command: \n```\nyum install -y puppet-bolt\n```\n\nAfter
    you have finished running these commands, click **Check** to make sure everything
    worked correctly.\n"
