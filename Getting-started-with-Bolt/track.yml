      to remote targets with SSH or WinRM, so you are not required to install any
      agent software.\r\n\r\nUse Bolt to:  \r\n\r\n- Patch and update systems\r\n-

      is a single action that you execute on target machines. With tasks, you can
      troubleshoot and deploy changes to individual or multiple systems in your infrastructure.\r\n\r\nA
      *plan* \U0001F4C3 is a bundle of tasks that can be combined with other logic.
      They allow you to do complex task operations, like running multiple tasks with
      one command or running certain tasks based on the output of another task."

    contents: "You can run tasks and plans from your tool of choice:\r\n\r\n- The
      console\r\n- The orchestrator command line interface (CLI)\r\n- The orchestrator
      API /command/task and /command/plan_run endpoints\r\n\r\n# Click *Start* to
