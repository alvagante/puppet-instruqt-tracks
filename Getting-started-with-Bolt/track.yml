  teaser: Learn what Bolt is and how it works, then try it for yourself!
  assignment: "First, you must configure the Bolt yum repository. \n\nThis is required
    because standard Linux installations are not configured with the Bolt repository.\n\nTo
    configure the repository, run the following command: `rpm -Uvh https://yum.puppet.com/puppet-tools-release-el-7.noarch.rpm`\n\nNow
    install Bolt by running this command: `yum install -y puppet-bolt`"
