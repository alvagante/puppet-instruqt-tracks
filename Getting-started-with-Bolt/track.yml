  title: Install Bolt on Linux
  teaser: Learn what Bolt is, and then install it to try it out for yourself!
  assignment: "# What is Bolt?\nBolt is an open source orchestration tool that automates
    the manual work it takes to maintain your infrastructure. You can use Bolt to
    automate tasks that you perform on an as-needed basis or as part of a greater
    orchestration workflow.\n\nBolt can be installed on your local workstation and
    connects directly to remote targets with SSH or WinRM, so you are not required
    to install any agent software.\nUse Bolt to:\n- Patch and update systems\n- Troubleshoot
    servers\n- Deploy applications\n- Stop and restart services\n\n# Install Bolt\nThe
    best way to learn how Bolt works is try it out for yourself.\n\nFirst, you'll
    need to install it. In order to do this, you must configure the Bolt yum repository.
    (This is required because standard Linux installations are not configured with
    the Bolt repository.)\n\nTo configure the repository, run the following command:
    \n```\nrpm -Uvh https://yum.puppet.com/puppet-tools-release-el-7.noarch.rpm\n```\n\nNow
    install Bolt by running this command: \n```\nyum install -y puppet-bolt\n```"
