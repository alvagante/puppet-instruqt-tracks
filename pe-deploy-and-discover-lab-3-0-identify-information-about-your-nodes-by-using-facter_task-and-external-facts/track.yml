  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab you'll learn how to use **facter_task** from within the PE console to create custom external facts, giving you a glimpse of how Puppet can be used as a customizable inventory system that provides visibility and insights on your infrastructure's nodes.

  **Prerequisites**

  None

      In this lab, you will use the PE console to:
       * Run `facter_task` against the nodes in your environment to discover which data center each node is located in.
       * Create an external fact to mark each node with its corresponding data center.

      Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.
  assignment: |-
    Facter gathers built-in (core) facts that are packaged with itself. It can also use scripts written by you or a third party to gather custom or external facts.

    In this exercise, you will install an external fact script that creates a datacenter fact. You will then verify that Facter can retrieve that fact with the script.

    1. First, check that the datacenter fact does not already exist. This command should produce no value:

    ```
    facter datacenter
    ```

    Next, move the provided external fact script into place:

    2. Navigate to your home directory:

    ```
    cd ~/
    ```

    3. Create the Facter location directory and external fact script:

    ```
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d
    sudo touch /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/datacenter.sh
    ```

    4. Add the following contents to the script, making sure to include the corresponding data center using the table above:

    ```
    #!/bin/sh
    echo "datacenter=pdx"
    ```

    5. Make the script executable:

    ```
    sudo chmod +x /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/datacenter.sh
    ```

    6. Finally, verify that the fact was installed and is accessible by Facter. Notice the new output:

    ```
    facter datacenter
    pdx
    ```

    7. Run the agent to send facts to the primary server.
