  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab you'll learn how to use **facter_task** from within the PE console to create custom external facts, giving you a glimpse of how Puppet can be used as a customizable inventory system that provides visibility and insights on your infrastructure's nodes.

  **Prerequisites**

  None

      In this lab, you will use the PE console to:
       * Run `facter_task` against the nodes in your environment to discover which data center each node is located in.
       * Create an external fact to mark each node with its corresponding data center.

      Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.
  assignment: |
    Facter gathers built-in (core) facts that are packaged within itself. It can also use scripts written by you or a third party to gather custom or external facts.

    In this exercise, you will install an external fact script that creates a datacenter fact. You will then verify that Facter can retrieve that fact with the script.

    1. First, check that the datacenter fact does not already exist. On the **linux1** tab, run the following command - it should produce no value:

    ```
    facter datacenter
    ```

    Next, move the provided external fact script into place:

    2. Navigate to your home directory:

    ```
    cd ~/
    ```

    3. Create the Facter location directory and external fact script by running the following command:

    ```
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d
    sudo touch /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/datacenter.sh
    ```

    4. Open the script using Vi:
    ```
    vi /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/datacenter.sh
    ```

    5. Add the following contents to the script, making sure to include the corresponding data center using the table above:
    ```
    #!/bin/sh
    echo "datacenter=pdx"
    ```

    5. Run the following command to make the script executable:
    ```
    sudo chmod +x /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/datacenter.sh
    ```

    6. Finally, verify that the fact was installed and is accessible by Facter. Run `facter datacener` again and notice the new output - it should return the output `pdx`.

    7. Run the Puppet agent to send facts to the Puppet server:
    ```
    puppet agent -t
    ```

    Congratulations! You installed an external fact script to create a datacenter fact, and then verified that facter was able to retrieve the data in the fact (location: pdx).
