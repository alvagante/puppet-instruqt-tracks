title: Install Bolt on Linux
teaser: Get started with Bolt on the Linux platform!
description: "Bolt is an ad hoc orchestration tool that is especially useful for remotely
  executing tasks on a large number of nodes.\r\n\r\nIn this track, you will learn:\r\n-
  What Bolt is and why it's useful.\r\n- How to install Bolt and verify that your
  installation works as expected.\r\n- How to run a simple Bolt command on a remote
  target node. \r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n**Why complete this track?**  \r\nIf you’re brand
  new to using Bolt, this is your starting point. Whether your goal is to quickly
  and easily troubleshoot ad hoc issues, ensure your systems are compliant, or deploy
  apps across your infrastructure, this is the first step needed to get there. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Before
  you get started**  \r\nKeep an eye on the clock! You will have 30 minutes to complete
  this track. At the end of 30 minutes your learning environment will automatically
  expire and your work will not be saved. If you have not completed the track, you
  can Restart the track and skip to any challenge."

  assignment: "# Install Bolt\nThe best way to learn about Bolt is to try it out for
    yourself. Begin by installing Bolt. To do this, you must configure the Bolt yum
    repository because standard Linux installations are not configured with the Bolt
    repository. \n\n# Step 1\nTo configure the Puppet package repository, run the
    following command:\n```\nrpm -Uvh https://yum.puppet.com/puppet-tools-release-el-7.noarch.rpm\n```\nThe
    `rpm -Uvh` command installs the package that configures the Bolt yum repository
    on the system. The `-Uvh` flags indicate update the system with this package (-U),
    enable verbose logging ( -v), and show a progress bar.\n\n# Step 2\n\nNow, install
    Bolt by running this command:\n```\nyum install -y puppet-bolt-3.1.0\n``` \n\nThe
    `yum` command is the Linux package manager that locates the specified package
    in any of the configured package repositories (in this case, puppet-bolt-3.1.0,)
    and installs it on the system. It also installs any package dependencies.\n\nThe
    `-y` option is merely for convenience - it means that the user will not be further
    prompted to install the specified package after the command is issued.\n\nNotice
    that a specific version of Bolt is installed in the previous command (3.1.0).
    The commands used in the rest of this track are designed to work with this Bolt
    version.\n\n✏️**Note:** \nThere are lots of ways to install Bolt. If you’d like
    to learn about those other methods, visit the [Bolt installation docs](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/bolt_installing.html).\n\nAfter
    you have finished running these commands, click **Check** to make sure everything
    worked correctly.\n"

    contents: "# What is Bolt?\r\nBolt is an open source orchestration tool that automates
      the manual work it takes to maintain your infrastructure. You can use Bolt to
      automate tasks that you perform on an as-needed basis or as part of a greater
      orchestration workflow.\r\n\r\nBolt can be installed on your local workstation
      and connects directly to remote targets with SSH or WinRM, so you are not required
      to install any agent software.\r\nUse Bolt to:\r\n- Patch and update systems\r\n-
      Troubleshoot servers\r\n- Deploy applications\r\n- Stop and restart services\r\n\r\nClick

  title: Verify Your Bolt Installation ✔️
  teaser: Make sure your Bolt installation works as expected.
  assignment: "A quick way to verify that your Bolt installation works as expected
    is to run some basic Bolt commands.\r\n\r\nFirst, display the Bolt version number
    by running this command:\r\n```\r\nbolt --version\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, display
    the Bolt help message by running this command:\r\n```\r\nbolt --help\r\n```\r\n\r\nBolt
    provides help for each individual subcommand as well. To check out help for a
    specific Bolt command, run:\r\n```\r\nbolt command --help\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter
    running each of these commands, click **Check** to continue."

  teaser: 'Run your first Bolt command on a remote target! '
  assignment: "The Network Time Protocol (NTP) service keeps all of the servers' clocks
    in sync. It’s important to configure this service to start automatically on servers
    that you add to your infrastructure. Accurate timekeeping ensures proper secure
    communications between remote clients and networked servers that host databases,
    web servers, and other applications. \n\n# Step 1\nFirst, check the status of
    the NTP service on two remote nodes, target1 and target2. Run this Bolt command:\n```\nbolt
    command run '/bin/systemctl status ntpd.service' --no-host-key-check --targets
    target1,target2\n```\n\nThis Bolt command logs in remotely to the target nodes
    and returns their NTP service status. \n\nThe`--nohost-key-check` portion of the
    command is optional and included here to: \n- suppress a warning that would be
    shown if the target has never been remotely accessed before. \n- prevent you from
    having to confirm the SSH fingerprint of the remote machine.\n \n# Step 2\nThe
    NTP service does not start by default. Run the following command to remotely log
    in again and start the service on each node:\n```\nbolt command run '/bin/systemctl
    start ntpd.service' --no-host-key-check --targets target1,target2\n```\n\nAfter
    you run this command, the NTP service starts on both target nodes.\n\n# Step 3\nRun
    the first Bolt command again to confirm that the NTP service has been started
    on both servers. \n\nYou can now add the servers to an existing infrastructure
    with additional configuration for their specific purposes.\n\nClick **Check**
    to continue. "
