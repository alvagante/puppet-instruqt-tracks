  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab you'll install the Puppet agent using two different methods: by using the PE console and by running an installation script. Knowing how to install the Puppet agent using either method will enable you to decide which method is best for your particular environment. Installing Puppet agents at scale prepares the infrastructure to  quickly, automatically scale up the number of nodes managed and configured as Puppet manifests are written and deployed to the PE Server.

  **Prerequisites**

  None

  **Before you start**

      In this lab you will:

      * Use the remote installation method via the PE console to install an agent on a target server.
      * Sign the new agent certificate via the console.
      * Use the local installation method via the frictionless installer script to install an agent on a target server.

      Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.

    ## Method 1: Install a PE agent locally using the install script on the command line

    1. On the **PE Console** tab, log in with username `admin` and password `puppetlabs`.
    2. From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Nodes** page.
    3. Click **Add Nodes** in the upper-right corner of the console.
    4. Click **Install Agents**.
    5. Copy the curl command that appears in the ***nix nodes** field at the right by selecting it and clicking CTRL+C/CMD+C or right-click+copy.
    6. Navigate to the Linux node by clicking on the **Linux Agent** tab. From there, paste and run the curl command. Running this command will install the PE agent.
    7. When the installation is complete, return to the **PE Console** tab and click the refresh button shown at the top right of the console.
    8. From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Certificates** page. Click the **Unsigned certificates** tab.
    9. Click **Accept** on the `nixagent` node listed there.
    10. Return to the Linux node by clicking on the **Linux Agent** tab, and then trigger a Puppet run:
    ````
    puppet agent -t
    ````
    11. In the **PE Console** tab, from the console sidebar, navigate to the **Nodes** page. You will see two nodes listed: the Puppet server and the `nixagent` node. Click the `nixagent` node.
    12. From the **Facts** tab, inspect the facts about the `nixagent` node.

    ## Method 2: Install a PE agent remotely using the PE console
    1. On the **PE Console** tab, log in with username `admin` and password `puppetlabs`.
    2. From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Nodes** page.
    3. Click **Add Nodes**, located in the upper right corner of the console.
    4. Click **Install Agents**.
    5. From the drop-down menu, select **WinRM**. Enter the following information, then click **Add nodes**:
     - WinRM hosts: `winagent`
     - User: `instruqt`
     - password: `Passw0rd!`
    6. From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Certificates** page. Click on the **Unsigned certificates** tab.
    7. Click **Accept** on the `winagent` node listed there.
    8. Navigate to the Windows node by clicking the **Windows Agent** tab, and then trigger a Puppet run:
    ````
    puppet agent -t
    ````
    9. In the **PE Console** tab, from the console sidebar, navigate to the **Nodes** page. You will see 3 nodes listed: the Puppet server, `nixagent`, and `winagent`. Click the `winagent` node.
    10. From the **Facts** tab, inspect the facts about the `winagent` node.

    Congratulations, you just installed Puppet agents!
