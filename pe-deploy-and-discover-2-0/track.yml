  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab you'll install the Puppet agent using two different methods: by using the PE console and by running an installation script. Knowing how to install the Puppet agent using either method will enable you to decide which method is best for your particular environment. Installing Puppet agents at scale prepares the infrastructure to  quickly, automatically scale up the number of nodes managed and configured as Puppet manifests are written and deployed to the PE Server.

  **Prerequisites**

  None

      In this lab you will:

      * Use the remote installation method via the PE console to install an agent on a target server.
      * Sign the new agent certificate via the console.
      * Use the local installation method via the frictionless installer script to install an agent on a target server.

      Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.

    ## Method 1: Install a PE agent locally using the install script on the command line

    1. On the **PE Console** tab, log in with username `admin` and password `puppetlabs`.
    2. From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Nodes** page.
    3. Click **Add Nodes**, located in the upper right corner of the console.
    4. Click **Install Agents**.
    5. Copy the curl command that appears in the ***nix nodes** field at the right by selecting it and clicking CTRL+C/CMD+C or right-click+copy.
    6. Navigate to the Linux node by clicking on the **linux1** tab. From there, run the curl command. Running this command will install the PE agent.
    7. After the installation finishes, return to the **PE Console** tab and click the refresh button shown at the top right of the console.
    8. From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Certificates** page. Click on the **Unsigned certificates** tab.
    9. Click **Accept** on the `linux1` node listed there.
    10. Return to the Linux node by clicking on the **linux1** tab, and then trigger a Puppet agent run:
    ````
    puppet agent -t
    ````
    11. In the **PE Console** tab, from the console sidebar, navigate to the **Nodes** page. You will see two nodes listed: the Puppet Server and the linux1 node. Click on the linux1 node.
    12. From the **Fact** tab, inspect the facts about the linux1 node.

    ## Method 2: Install a PE agent remotely using the PE console
