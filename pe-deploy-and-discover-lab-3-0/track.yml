  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab you'll learn how to use **facter_task** from within the PE console to create custom external facts, giving you a glimpse of how Puppet can be used as a customizable inventory system that provides visibility and insights on your infrastructure's nodes.

  **Prerequisites**

  None

      In this lab, you will use the PE console to:
       * Run `facter_task` against the nodes in your environment to discover which data center each node is located in.
       * Create an external fact to mark each node with its corresponding data center.

      Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.
  assignment: |
    Facter gathers built-in (core) facts that are packaged within itself. It can also gather custom or external facts by using scripts that you or a third party have written.

    In this exercise, you will install an external fact script that creates a data center fact. You will then verify that Facter can retrieve that fact with the script.

    1. Switch to the **PE Console** tab.

    2. Log into the console with ID `admin` and password `puppetlabs`.

    3. Click on **Orchestration->Tasks** and then click on the **Run a task** button.

    4. Type `facter_task` in the **Task** text box.

    5. Type `fact` in the **Parameter** text box and `timezone` in the **Value** text box.

    6. Click the **Add to task** button.

    7. Select **Node list** in **Select targets** dropdown.

    8. Type `agent` in the **Add nodes** text box and click the **Search** button.

    9. Click the **Add all** link and click the **Run task** button.

    10. Note the timezone of the `nixagent` and `winagent` nodes.

    4. Create an external fact.
    Now that you have the time zone, you can use it to identify which data center each node is located:

    | Time zone | Datacenter      |
    |-----------|-----------------|
    | Eastern   | datacenter-east |
    | Pacific   | datacenter-west |

    5. First, check that the data center fact does not already exist. On the **Linux Agent** tab, run the following command — it should produce no value:

    ```
    facter datacenter
    ```

    Next, move the provided external fact script into place:

    6. Navigate to your home directory:

    ```
    cd ~/
    ```

    7. Create the Facter location directory and external fact script:

    ```
    mkdir -p /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d
    ```

    8. Open the script using the vi editor:
    ```
    vi /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/datacenter.sh
    ```

    9. Add the following contents to the script, making sure to include the corresponding data center using the table above:
    ```
    #!/bin/sh
    echo "datacenter=datacenter-east"
    ```

    10. Make the script executable:
    ```
    chmod +x /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/datacenter.sh
    ```

    11. Finally, verify that the fact was installed and is accessible by Facter. Run `facter datacenter` again and notice the new output - it should return `datacenter-east`.

    12. Run the Puppet agent to send facts to the Puppet server:
    ```
    puppet agent -t
    ```

    Congratulations! You installed an external fact script to create a data center fact, and then verified that facter was able to retrieve the data in the fact (location: datacenter-east).
