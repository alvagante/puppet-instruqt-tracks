  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab, you'll install the Puppet agent using two different methods: locally using installation script and remotely from the PE console. Both methods enable you to install agents at scale.

  Installing agents at scale prepares your infrastructure to quickly and automatically scale up the number of nodes managed and configured as Puppet manifests are written and deployed to the primary Puppet server.


  **Prerequisites**

  None

      In this lab, you will:

      * Install an agent locally on a node by using the installation script.
      * Install an agent remotely on a node by using the PE console.
      * For both methods, sign the new agent certificate by using the console.


      Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.

    ## Method 1: Install an agent locally by running the installation script from the node's command line

    1. On the **PE Console** tab, log in with username `admin` and password `puppetlabs`.
    2. From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Nodes** page.
    3. In the upper-right corner of the console, click **Add Nodes**.
    4. On the **Add nodes to inventory** page, click **Install Agents**.
    5. Copy the curl command that is shown in the ***nix nodes** field at the right of the console by selecting it and clicking CTRL+C/CMD+C or right-click+copy.
    6. Navigate to the Linux node by clicking the **Linux Agent** tab. Then, paste and run the curl command. This command installs the Puppet agent.
    7. When the installation is complete, return to the **PE Console** tab and click **Refresh** at the top right of the console.
    8. Now you have to sign the agent's certificate. From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Certificates** page and click the **Unsigned certificates** tab.
    9. On the list of nodes, find the `nixagent` node and click **Accept**.
    10. Return to the Linux node by clicking on the **Linux Agent** tab, and then trigger a Puppet run:
    ````
    puppet agent -t
    ````
    11. In the **PE Console** tab, from the console sidebar, navigate to the **Nodes** page. You'll see two nodes listed: the Puppet server and the `nixagent` node. Click the `nixagent` node.
    12. On the **Facts** tab, inspect the facts about the `nixagent` node.

    ## Method 2: Install a Puppet agent remotely from the PE console
    1. If you're not already logged in, on the **PE Console** tab, log in with username `admin` and password `puppetlabs`.
    2. From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Nodes** page.
    3. In the upper-right corner of the console, click **Add Nodes**.
    4. On the **Add nodes to inventory** page, click **Install Agents**.
    5. From the **Transport method** list, select **WinRM**. Enter the following information, and then click **Add nodes**:
     - WinRM hosts: `winagent`
     - User: `Administrator`
     - password: `Puppetlabs!`

    The installation might take a few minutes. To check the status of installation, go to the PE console **Tasks** page, click the **winagent** node, and examine the node run result: When the installation is complete (typically a minute or two), you'll see a certname in the output. Keep refreshing the PE console page (by clicking the refresh icon in the upper right of the page) until the certificate is available to sign.

    6. Now you have to sign the agent's certificate. From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Certificates** page and click the **Unsigned certificates** tab.
    7. In the list of nodes, find `winagent` and click **Accept**.
    8. Navigate to the Windows node by clicking the **Windows Agent** tab, and from the Windows Start Menu, select **Start Command Prompt with Puppet**. Then, trigger a Puppet run at the command prompt:
    ````
    puppet agent -t
    ````
    9. Click the **PE Console** tab, and from the console sidebar, navigate to the **Nodes** page. You will see 3 nodes listed: the Puppet server, `nixagent`, and `winagent`. Click the `winagent` node.
    10. From the **Facts** tab, inspect the facts about the `winagent` node.

    Congratulations, you just installed Puppet agents locally from the command line and remotely from the console!
