  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab, you'll learn how to configure the primary Puppet server to download the packages needed to install agents on different operating systems, making agent deployment faster and easier across your infrastructure.

      In this lab, you will:

      1. Attempt an agent installation on a node with a different OS than the primary server.
      2. Configure the primary server to provide OS-specific agent packages so that you can install agents across a variety of nodes.
      3. Attempt the agent installation again and autosign the agent certificate by providing a challenge password.

      Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.
  assignment: |
    1. Click the **Linux Agent** tab to go to the Linux node. Then, install an agent by running the installation script with the following parameter: `custom_attributes:challengePassword`
    Tip: Click the command below to copy it, and then right-click and paste it on the command line.

    ```
    uri='https://puppet:8140/packages/current/install.bash'
    curl --insecure "$uri" | bash -s custom_attributes:challengePassword=PASSWORD_FOR_AUTOSIGNER_SCRIPT
    ```

    2. In the output, notice the failure:

    ```
      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
    100 20122  100 20122    0     0   122k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  123k
    curl failed to get https://puppet:8140/packages/2019.8.6/el-8-x86_64.bash
    The agent packages needed to support el-8-x86_64 are not present on your primary server.
    To add them, apply the pe_repo::platform::el_8_x86_64 class to your master node, and then run Puppet.
    The required agent packages should be retrieved when puppet runs on the master, after which you can run the install.bash script again.
    #
    ```

    The installation fails because the EL8 package isn't present on the primary server - the primary server isn't running EL8. To ensure that the packages are present, you must add the `pe_repo::platform:<AGENT_OS_VERSION_ARCHITECTURE>` classes to the primary server.

    3. On the **PE Console** tab, log into PE with username `admin`and password `puppetlabs`.

    4. From the console sidebar, navigate to the **Node groups** page. Expand (click **+**) **PE Infrastructure** and click **PE Master**.

    5. Add the repository class for the agent node OS that you want to support. On the **Classes** tab, enter `pe_repo` in **Add new class**. From the list of classes, select the `pe_repo::platform::el_8_x86_64` repo class and click **Add class**.

    6. Commit your change: Click **Commit** in the bottom right of the page.

    7. On the **Primary Server** tab, run Puppet to manually trigger the download of the new agent package to the primary server:
    ```
    puppet agent -t
    ```

    8. Click the **Linux Agent** tab. Then, install the agent on the Linux node by running the installation script and including the `custom_attributes:challengePassword` parameter to autosign the agent certificate:

    ```
    uri='https://puppet:8140/packages/current/install.bash'
    curl --insecure "$uri" | sudo bash -s custom_attributes:challengePassword=PASSWORD_FOR_AUTOSIGNER_SCRIPT
    ```

    Congratulations! You now know how to configure PE to support installing agents that run a different OS than the primary server.
