  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab, you'll learn how to manage users and roles in Puppet Enterprise (PE) so that you can control what users can and can't do within PE. Assigning users to roles is more efficient than managing permissions for individual users.

  **Prerequisites**

  None

      In this lab, you will create a Puppet Enterprise user and grant limited permissions from the PE console.

      User roles are sets of permissions you can apply to multiple users. You can't assign permissions to single users in PE, only to user roles.

      Managing access based on roles — or, role-based access — is more efficient than managing user permissions on a per-user basis.

      Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.
  assignment: |-
    1. On the **PE Console** tab, log in with username `admin` and password `puppetlabs`.
    ✏️ Note: If the console doesn't load correctly, refresh your browser window.

    2. From the console sidebar, click **Access Control**.

    3. In the **Full name** field, enter the user's name using standard capitalization and spacing.
    ✏️ Note: Not sure what name to use? Feel free to use your own!

    4. In the **Login** field, enter a username for the user, such as: `firstname.lastname`. Then, click **Add local user**. The name is added to the list.

    5. Click the username to open the **User details** page.

    6. In the top-right corner of the page, click **Generate password reset**, copy the link, and then click **Close**.

    7. Paste the link in a new web browser tab. Then, enter a new password and click **Reset password**.
    ✏️ Note: Choose a memorable password — you'll use it to log in on the final step.

    8. Close the browser tab and go back to the **PE Console** tab within the lab. In the sidebar, click **Access Control**, and then click the **User roles** tab.

    9. In the list of roles, click **Viewers**. On the **Member users** tab, select the new user from the list, and then click **Add user**.

    10. Commit your changes — see the button in the bottom-right corner of the page.

    11. To verify the settings, log in as the new user: In the console sidebar, click **Log out**, and then log in again with the username and password that you set in steps 4 and 7. From here you can explore your user settings.

    Congratulations! Using the PE console, you just created a user and assigned them to a role that has limited permissions in PE.
