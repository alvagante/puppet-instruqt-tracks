title: Build a Bolt Inventory File on Linux
teaser: In this track, you'll create a Bolt inventory file and use it to run a task
  on multiple remote nodes
description: "\nThe Bolt inventory file is a core piece of functionality for managing
  large fleets of targets. It allows you to define groups of targets so they can be
  referenced as a single entity in a Bolt command. You can also use the inventory
  file to set up different connection settings for each of those targets, and store
  additional information about the targets. With an inventory file in place, you are
  able to remotely run commands on a large group of targets with a single Bolt command,
  instead of running it repeatedly for each individual target. \n\n**What you will
  learn:**\n\n* First, you will build an inventory file and define your targets.\n*
  Then, you will run a command on your targets to ensure the file is set up correctly.
  \n* Next, you will build a task (written as a Bash script). \n* Finally, you will
  use the inventory file to run the task on your targets.\n\n**Why complete this track?**\n\nCreating
  a Bolt Inventory file allows you to quickly and easily run tasks across groups of
  targets, saving you time and effort.\n\n**Before you get started**\n\nKeep an eye
  on the clock! You will have 30 minutes to complete this track. At the end of 30
  minutes your learning environment will automatically expire and your work will not
  be saved. If you have not completed the track, you can Restart the track and skip
  to any challenge."

  assignment: "Use an inventory file to store information about your targets, control
    how Bolt connects to them, and arrange them into groups. Grouping your targets
    lets you aim your Bolt commands at the group instead of having to reference each
    target individually.\n\nAn inventory file is part of a Bolt project and must exist
    alongside a bolt-project.yaml file. \n\nIn this challenge, you will use the Editor
    tab to create a Bolt inventory file that will describe all of the machines that
    you wish to invoke Bolt commands and tasks on.\n\n**Step 1**\n\n**Step 2**\n\n**Step
    3**\n\n**Step 4**"
